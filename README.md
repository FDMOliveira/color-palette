# Color Palette
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project uses a react functional component in which you can get the color palette from an image.
You can choose one image from the left panel, or upload your own.
Hooks are used to have state and a function to update state.
